# scBasset: A Beginner's Guide to Sequence-Based Single-Cell Chromatin Accessibility Analysis

## What Makes scBasset Different?

While most methods for analyzing single-cell chromatin accessibility data (scATAC-seq) treat genomic regions as simple coordinate labels, scBasset takes a fundamentally different approach: **it reads and learns from the actual DNA sequences**. Think of it as the difference between analyzing a library by just looking at shelf locations versus actually reading the content of the books.

## The Core Innovation: From Coordinates to Sequences

### Traditional Approach (Sequence-Free)
Most existing methods work like this:
- Take a peak-by-cell matrix (rows = cells, columns = genomic regions)
- Treat each region as an abstract feature with coordinates like "chr1:1000-2000"
- Ignore what DNA sequences actually exist in those regions
- Apply dimensionality reduction or clustering algorithms
- Post-hoc analysis to figure out which transcription factors might be involved

### scBasset's Approach (Sequence-Dependent)
scBasset revolutionizes this by:
- Taking the actual **1,344 base pairs of DNA sequence** from each peak's center
- Using **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** to learn regulatory patterns directly from sequence
- Treating each cell as a separate prediction task
- Learning which sequence features predict accessibility in each cell type

## Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks for DNA

### Why CNNs Work for DNA Analysis

CNNs were originally designed for image recognition, but they're perfect for DNA because:

1. **Local Pattern Recognition**: Just like CNNs detect edges and shapes in images, they can detect transcription factor binding motifs in DNA
2. **Translation Invariance**: A motif has the same meaning whether it appears at position 100 or position 500 in a sequence
3. **Hierarchical Learning**: Early layers learn simple motifs, deeper layers learn complex regulatory grammar

### The scBasset Architecture

#### Input Layer
- Takes 1,344 bp DNA sequences from peak centers
- Converts to 4×1,344 matrix using one-hot encoding:
  - A = [1,0,0,0]
  - T = [0,1,0,0]  
  - G = [0,0,1,0]
  - C = [0,0,0,1]

#### Convolution Tower (8 blocks)
Each block contains:
- **1D Convolution**: Scans for sequence patterns (like motif detection)
- **Batch Normalization**: Stabilizes training
- **Max Pooling**: Reduces dimensions while preserving important features
- **GELU Activation**: Introduces non-linearity

The filters progressively increase: 288 → 323 → 363 → 407 → 456 → 512 → 256

#### Bottleneck Layer (32 units)
- Compresses sequence information into a 32-dimensional "sequence embedding"
- This embedding captures all the regulatory information from the 1,344 bp sequence
- Acts as a compressed representation of the sequence's regulatory potential

#### Final Dense Layer
- **Key Innovation**: Contains one weight vector per cell in the dataset
- These weight vectors serve as **cell embeddings**
- Each vector specifies how that cell uses the sequence features for accessibility prediction
- Prediction = sequence_embedding · cell_embedding

## How Training Works: Multi-Task Learning

### The Learning Process

1. **Forward Pass**: 
   - Input a DNA sequence
   - CNN processes it into a sequence embedding
   - Multiply by each cell's weight vector to predict accessibility in every cell

2. **Loss Calculation**:
   - Compare predictions to observed accessibility (binary: accessible or not)
   - Use binary cross-entropy loss

3. **Backpropagation**:
   - CNN learns to extract relevant sequence features
   - Cell embeddings learn how each cell type uses those features

### What the Model Learns

- **Sequence Features**: Motifs, regulatory grammar, nucleotide composition effects
- **Cell Representations**: How each cell type interprets sequence features
- **Regulatory Logic**: Which combinations of motifs drive accessibility in which cell types

## Key Capabilities of scBasset

### 1. Superior Cell Clustering and Representation

**Performance Metrics**:
- Consistently outperforms existing methods on clustering accuracy
- Better consistency with paired RNA-seq data in multiome experiments
- Higher adjusted rand index (ARI) and adjusted mutual information (AMI)

**Why It Works Better**:
- Leverages sequence information that other methods ignore
- Learns biologically meaningful features (motifs, regulatory elements)
- Cell embeddings capture how cells interpret regulatory sequences

### 2. Batch Correction (scBasset-BC)

**The Problem**: Different experimental batches can create technical artifacts

**scBasset's Solution**:
- Adds a parallel "batch-specific" layer after the bottleneck
- Batch contribution = batch_embedding · sequence_embedding  
- Final prediction = cell_contribution + batch_contribution
- L2 regularization controls the balance between batch mixing and biological preservation

**Performance**:
- Achieves better balance between batch mixing and biological signal preservation
- Particularly effective for unbalanced batch designs (common in real experiments)

### 3. Advanced Data Denoising

**The Challenge**: scATAC-seq data is extremely sparse (85-95% zeros)

**scBasset's Approach**:
- Uses learned sequence features to predict "true" accessibility states
- Provides continuous probability scores instead of binary accessible/not accessible
- Corrects for sequencing depth automatically (captured in intercept term)

**Validation Results**:
- Improves correlation between gene accessibility and gene expression in multiome data
- Better preservation of cell-cell relationships
- More robust differential accessibility analysis
- Superior performance in data integration tasks

### 4. Transcription Factor Activity Inference

This is where scBasset truly shines compared to other methods:

#### Motif Insertion Experiments
1. **Generate Background Sequences**: Create 1,000 dinucleotide-shuffled sequences from real peaks
2. **Insert Motif**: Add a specific TF motif to the center of each background sequence
3. **Predict Accessibility**: Run both original and motif-inserted sequences through scBasset
4. **Calculate Activity**: TF activity = difference in predicted accessibility
5. **Cell-Specific Scores**: Average across sequences to get per-cell TF activity

#### Validation Against Known Biology
- **CEBPB**: Highest activity in monocytes (known monocyte regulator)
- **GATA1**: Most active in erythroid progenitors (key erythroid regulator)  
- **HOXA9**: Highest in hematopoietic stem cells (known stem cell regulator)

#### Comparison with chromVAR
- scBasset TF activities correlate significantly better with TF expression
- Particularly superior for activating TFs (P < 7.38×10^-12)
- Also better at identifying repressive TFs (more negative correlations)

### 5. In Silico Saturation Mutagenesis (ISM)

**Concept**: Systematically mutate every position in a sequence to understand regulatory importance

**Process**:
1. Take a sequence of interest (e.g., β-globin enhancer)
2. For each position, mutate to all 3 alternative nucleotides
3. Predict change in accessibility for each mutation
4. Generate "importance scores" for every nucleotide

**β-globin Enhancer Example**:
- Identified GATA1 and KLF1 motifs as most important
- Showed increasing importance during erythroid differentiation
- Validated against known experimental data

**Applications**:
- Identify critical regulatory elements
- Predict effects of genetic variants
- Understand cell-type-specific regulatory logic
